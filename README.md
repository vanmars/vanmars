# :sparkles: Hi there, I'm Vanessa! 

> I love being able to work patiently and methodically through a problem to create tools that actually matter!

## About Me
:herb: I taught middle and high school English for five years before deciding to learn to program so that I could design my own EdTech tools. Coding unearthed passions for puzzles and problem-solving and the creative process. 

:herb:  In 2020, I attended a 5-month web and mobile development immersive through Epidcodus, where I enjoyed pair programming daily, building cool projects, and strengthening my JavaScript skills while adding Ruby, Rails, and React.js to my repetoire. I then completed two internships both using React, to gain more real-world experience. The first was a 5-week internship with [JobsMight.io](https://jobsmight.io/), followed by a part-time 8-week internship with the [CollabLab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/).

:herb:  My first job in tech was at a small Portland-based agency, called [SlideFactory](https://theslidefactory.com/), where I contributed to a variety of projects using nice diversity of tech stacks. I LOVE learning new things, so it was an absolute joy.

## What I'm Working On
:herb: I am currently working at Shopify and am learning all about front-end development at a large company!

:herb:  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me and serve others. I am particularly interested in projects related to learning and education.
