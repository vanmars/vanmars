## About Me
I taught middle and high school English for five years before deciding to learn to program so that I could design my own edtech tools. Coding unearthed passions for puzzles and problem-solving and the creative process. I love being able to work patiently and methodically through a problem to create tools that actually matter.

## What I'm Working On
- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently in a 5-month developer bootcamp through Epicodus: https://www.epicodus.com/
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™ll be adding React and C#/.Net to my repertoire along with over 800 hours of pair programming!
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me and serve others. I am particularly interested in projects related to learning and education.
- ðŸ’¬  Ask me about education technology and learning theory.
