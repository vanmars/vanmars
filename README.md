> I love being able to work patiently and methodically through a problem to create tools that actually matter!

## About Me
I taught middle and high school English for five years before deciding to learn to program so that I could design my own EdTech tools. Coding unearthed passions for puzzles and problem-solving and the creative process. 

## What I'm Working On
- :books: I’m currently in a 5-month developer bootcamp through [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).
- I’ll be adding React and Ruby/Ruby on Rails to my repertoire along with over 800 hours of pair programming!
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me and serve others. I am particularly interested in projects related to learning and education.
- :speech_balloon: Ask me about education technology and learning theory.
- :mailbox: How to reach me: vanmariestewart@gmail.com
